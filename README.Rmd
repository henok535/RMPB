# RMPB
Reproducibility Metric for Predictive Biomarkers package.

## Description
This is an R package consisting of a set of functions used to estimate a
reproducibility metric $\Delta_r$. First a metric $\tetha$ under the gold standard
biomarker is estimated. Then $\theta$ under the modified biomarker is estimated.
The reproducibility metrix then will be the difference between these two values.
